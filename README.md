Cognitive AI through Mnemonic Interfaces
Project Overview
This repository contains the conceptual and prototype implementation of a mnemonic interface for AI systems aimed at developing cognitive intelligence. The approach integrates pharmacological ontology, mnemonic structuring, and neuro-symbolic reasoning potential.

Key Components

    Pharmacological Ontology: A domain-specific conceptual map created using a combination of NLP and structured data modeling.
    Mnemonic Interface Prototype: A web-based demo interface representing concepts and associative structures to aid interpretability.
    Cognitive Reasoning: A theoretical framework allowing future integration with neuro-inspired symbolic reasoning agents.

Files and Structure

    /ontology/ â€“ Data and scripts related to ontology construction
    /interface/ â€“ HTML/JS prototype of the mnemonic interface
    /figures/ â€“ Visual materials (diagrams and infographics)
    article_draft.docx â€“ Full draft of the article
    README.md â€“ This document

How to Run the Interface

    Clone or download the repository.
    Navigate to the /interface/ directory.
    Open index.html in your web browser (double-click or right-click â†’ "Open with browser").
        No installation is required for this static prototype.
    Interact with the visual concept map and hover over nodes to see mnemonic hints.

Example:

cd interface
start index.html

Future Work

    Integration with Hugging Face Transformers
    Testing symbolic reasoning over mnemonic-conceptual links
    Educational use-case development
    Backend integration (e.g., Flask or FastAPI for dynamic responses)
